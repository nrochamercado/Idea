# Game
This program's purpose is to serve as learning experience for myself and others who view it.
This was coded in c++ with not external libraries, only c++ standard libaries.

The idea file is the original file that I had submitted to Cutie hack 2025. 
Its contains a error:
1. Change inital player location to 1, it is curretnly 5 which starts at the fifth room and not at the beginning.

If any more errors are found in the inital version I will add to the list

The revised version contains an updated version where I had more time and learned from my first attempt.(In Progress)
