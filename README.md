# Game
This program's purpose is to serve as learning experience for myself and others who view it.
This was coded in c++ with not external libraries, only c++ standard libaries.

The game file is the original file that I had submitted to Cutie hack 2025. Its contains an error where you need to change the inital value of player location and set it to 1 and is missing a screen that disappeared.
The revised version contains an updated version where I had more time and learned from my first attempt.(In Progress)
