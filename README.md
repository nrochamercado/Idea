# Game
This program's purpose is to serve as learning experience for myself and others who view it.
This was coded in c++ with not external libraries, only c++ standard libaries.

The idea file is the original file that I had submitted to Cutie hack 2025. 
Its contains a error:
1. Change inital player location to 1, it is curretnly 5 which starts at the fifth room and not at the beginning.

If any more errors are found in the inital version I will add to the list

The revised version contains an updated version where I had more time and learned from my first attempt to complete the game.
This version is more polished but feel free to make improvements yourself like readding Jerry or making the room before entering the boss room lead into the boss room.
